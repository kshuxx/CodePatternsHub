Patterns are the **building blocks of programming**! 🎯 **CodePatternsHub** is a repository that brings together programming patterns from different languages.Starting with Python. All patterns are designed to be interactive and take user input, allowing you to see the results change based on your input. 💻

## 📂 Patterns Covered

Here’s a sneak peek at what you’ll find:

1. **⭐ Star Patterns**: Explore classic star patterns like pyramids, diamonds, and more!
2. **🔢 Number Patterns**: Delve into patterns created with numbers in various sequences.
3. **🔠 Alphabet Patterns**: Discover creative shapes and sequences using alphabets.
4. **🔍 Unnamed or Complex Patterns**: Unique and intricate patterns that are hard to categorize or name!
